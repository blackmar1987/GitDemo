Feature: BeforeAndAfterAnnotations

  //if you want to run something before specified with tag tests - you should use @Before("@MobileTest") annotation
  // -->>> stepDefinations.hooks
  //YO CAN NOT USE Background and @Before together!!!

  //Background keyword is the same as BeforeClass annotation - it will be runned before all of scenarios
  //2 scenarios = 2 Background runned
  //but this is a prerequest for current feature file only
  //that means that Background scenarion can be started after some other scenarios from another feature files
